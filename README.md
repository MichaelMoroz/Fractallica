# Fractallica
The ray marched, Lua scripted, fractal engine.

Fractallica is a game engine based off of [MMCE](https://github.com/WAUthethird/Marble-Marcher-Community-Edition). While still in its **early alpha phase**, new features, bug fixes, and releases are being added quite often.

## Lua documentation
Fractallica is written in C++, but for many of the functions are being warpped in Lua classes. [Click here](https://github.com/MichaelMoroz/Fractallica/blob/master/docs/README.md) to visit the documentation or look in the `docs` folder.
